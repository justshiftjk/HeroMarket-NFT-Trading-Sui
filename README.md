# Heros NFT AMM on Sui

The First NFT AMM Smart Contract on SUI Blockchain.
This allows for users to trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to each other.
Everything on Sui is still on early stage, and we are in front of Sui pioneers.

This NFT AMM Smart Contract is still on demo version and consist of several TODO parts.

The smart contract has minimum features for Trading, like `list` / `transfer` / `buy` / `sell` and so on.
But planning to implement `Auctions` & `Raffles` feature which is very popular in traditional NFT marketplaces.

Would be appreciated if many folks drop advises and proposals.
